Lying in Bed Calculator
====

How much time do you waste lying in bed in the morning? Find out with this simple Javascript app that uses your age and the minutes you spend awake in bed in the morning to tell you how much time you have wasted and will continue to waste, as well as how much time you'll save if you cut down a few minutes.

This is a simple app that was hastily created while I was learning about [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org). It was built out of the [3.js](http://arturadib.com/hello-backbonejs/docs/3.html) Backbone tutorial.
